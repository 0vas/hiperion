# Agent integration

Hyperion runs separately from the agent and owns workflow state. The agent proposes a plan, claims ready work, performs it with its own tools, and reports evidence. The human participates through the web interface.

For setup in Codex, Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor and other local clients, follow the [connection guide](conexion.md). The user starts with a natural-language request; the host agent generates the plan and includes its original text in `plan.request`. Do not ask the user to author JSON.

## Minimal user request

“Use Hyperion to prepare a welcome guide for my project” is sufficient. The user specifies the outcome; the integration owns planning, task contracts, progress logs and handoffs. Read available conversation/project context before asking for missing information. Ask only material unresolved questions and add human approvals only when warranted by the activity or explicitly requested. Do not require users to prescribe steps, repeat I/O/logging instructions, or include an artificial wait in their prompt. Generating a draft does not imply publishing or sending it. The cooperative host-resume limitation must be explained when a handoff occurs, not encoded as part of the user's goal.

## No prior context

Acceptance criteria: a host can start from an activity with no conversation history, repository or general context; missing facts become relevant manual inputs; explicit run identity recovers persisted state; unrelated runs never become implicit context.

Business input is the user's activity plus optional supporting context. Treat absent context as unknown, not as permission to infer the project from Hyperion's own repository or another run. Generate a small discovery phase only when material facts are missing; wire its typed outputs into downstream tasks. Do not ask the user to specify protocol mechanics. If there is no objective, ask for it before constructing task-specific work.

A fresh chat resumes by run ID/link and reads the stored state. Distinguish this from a new activity; ask when the target run is ambiguous. A local integration can discover its runtime/service without depending on the calling workspace.

Current responsibility boundary: a connected host agent produces the full plan for `create_run`; the HTTP/MCP server validates and stores it. It is not a natural-language planning endpoint. An external application without an agent needs a planning/execution adapter. Lack of prior business context is supported; automatic installation, remote access and universal recognition of the word “Hyperion” are not implied.

Validation uses the installed portable runner from an empty temporary workspace, an arbitrary integration identity and no general context, alongside an unrelated stored run. A subsequent CLI process recovers the correct result by run ID. This validates transport/state isolation, not autonomous LLM interpretation of an unseen prompt.

## Portable invocation

Prefer `hyperion install` for local agents supporting Agent Skills and shell access. The installed skill recognizes requests to use Hyperion and launches the same compiled CLI independently of vendor MCP settings. Its script pins the runtime/data paths; `--agent ID` registers a caller without a vendor allowlist. The CLI starts or reuses the authenticated local server automatically. A standalone npm archive includes production assets; no source checkout is needed at runtime. See [the connection guide](conexion.md) for the one-time installation and host-discovery limits.

## This Codex conversation

Use the repository CLI. New MCP configuration does not automatically inject tools into an already running conversation.

1. Read `npm run hyperion -- --help`.
2. Generate a JSON plan from the user’s request using the [protocol](protocol.md) and create it with `npm run hyperion -- create PLAN.json UNIQUE_REQUEST_ID`.
3. Show the returned URL to the user.
4. Read `get RUN_ID`. Start only agent steps whose status is `ready` while the run is `active`.
5. Execute real work. Report progress with `log`; report an actual result with `complete`, or a failure with `fail`.
6. For `manual` and `approval` steps, wait for the user's action in the browser. Never submit or approve on the user's behalf.
7. Show the URL in a progress message and use `wait RUN_ID REVISION 30` (or MCP `hyperion_wait`) before ending the turn. On a revision change, read the human decision and continue ready work in this same turn. A timeout is not approval. If ending the turn, explain that the idle chat needs the canvas continuation message; do not promise automatic wakeups.
8. If the run is cancelled or rejected, stop scheduling. Respect pauses. A pause permits reporting the result of work already started.

Independent ready steps may be active together. Only do this when the underlying actions are genuinely independent. A running indicator means a start was recorded; it does not prove the external agent is still alive.

## MCP stdio

Recommended: `npm run hyperion -- setup codex` (or `claude` / `cursor`) configures the adapter and local startup on demand. Reload tools or open a new client session. For structured gateways, typed outputs and public traces, follow the [process contract](process-contract.md).

Manual alternative: build and start the HTTP server first. Run `npm run hyperion -- connect CLIENT_ID` to register an identity and generate an absolute-path MCP configuration without credentials. Register the adapter in a compatible MCP client:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "hyperion": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/hiperion/dist/adapters/mcp.js"],
      "env": {
        "HYPERION_AGENT_ID": "codex",
        "HYPERION_DATA_DIR": "/absolute/path/to/hiperion/.hyperion",
        "HYPERION_URL": "http://127.0.0.1:4317"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Clients have different configuration locations. The example defines the portable command and environment, not a universal configuration file path.

For Codex, the CLI supports registering stdio servers:

```sh
codex mcp add hyperion \
  --env HYPERION_AGENT_ID=codex \
  --env HYPERION_DATA_DIR=/absolute/path/to/hiperion/.hyperion \
  --env HYPERION_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4317 \
  -- node /absolute/path/to/hiperion/dist/adapters/mcp.js
```

Verify with `codex mcp get hyperion` and use a session in which the tools are loaded. This command changes your local Codex MCP configuration; it is an optional setup step, not part of the server startup. Documentation: [official OpenAI MCP guidance](https://developers.openai.com/codex/mcp).

| Tool                   | Behavior                                                        |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `hyperion_create_run`  | Validate and persist a plan; return a browser URL               |
| `hyperion_list_runs`   | Read recent executions                                          |
| `hyperion_get_run`     | Read state, decisions, results and history                      |
| `hyperion_step`        | `start`, `log`, `complete`, `fail`, or `retry` an agent step    |
| `hyperion_revise_plan` | Revise future work, preserve history and pause for human review |
| `hyperion_wait`        | Wait up to 55 seconds for a revision change                     |

Create/step tools require `commandId`. Reuse it when retrying a transport request with the same content. A different action or changed content requires a new ID. The MCP server intentionally exposes no human approval tool. It uses the same HTTP contract as the CLI, with no direct access to the database.

## Other providers and environments

An agent with HTTP or shell access can use the same protocol. MCP support alone does not guarantee that an agent can remain alive waiting for a decision or wake a conversation. Document those capabilities per integration. A remote/cloud agent cannot reach `127.0.0.1` on your laptop; remote access is outside this release.

Set `HYPERION_AGENT_ID` to a registered identity when using CLI/MCP. Each identity has its own credential and can coexist in the same data directory; registration preserves existing credentials and is picked up by the running server. A run retains its original coordinator. Identities share read access within this trusted local deployment, but cannot mutate another coordinator’s agent steps. These are integration identities, not an isolation boundary against programs running as the same OS user.

## User-selected presentation

MCP offers `hyperion_open` with `runId` and `presentation: split|desktop`, including hosts without shell access. `hyperion open RUN_ID split` returns the existing browser URL. `hyperion open RUN_ID desktop` authenticates that run and launches the Desktop executable registered by its first launch, with explicit argument arrays (no shell). Presentation changes never create a run. The same loopback service and data directory back both views. Desktop intentionally refuses switching to a different service while a window is open.

The executable registration is local to the current user (`~/.hyperion/desktop.json`); it contains paths, not agent credentials. A development installation can override its home using `HYPERION_HOME`. Desktop includes Electron's Node runtime to start the service when absent. Closing the client preserves the service for chat/split continuation.

## When the conversation changes the remaining plan

Use revision only for an explicit change in the user's activity. Read current state, finish any in-flight task, preserve executed/presented definitions and send `hyperion_revise_plan` (MCP) or a `revise` command (CLI/HTTP). Include the complete plan, latest revision and reason. The run pauses for the person to review the diff and resume. Continue in that same run after their next message. Never replan to bypass a human decision, rewrite evidence or silently recover from an execution failure; use retry for failures. See [protocol](protocol.md#exceptional-plan-revision).
